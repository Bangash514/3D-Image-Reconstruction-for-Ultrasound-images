# 3D-Image-Reconstruction-for-Ultrasound-images

Steps of algorithm;
1: Load the images (DICOM, png or jpg)
2: Reconstruct them into a 3D volume by using VTK's vtkImageData object.
3: Create mapper and actor to visualize the reconstructed volume in a renderer, and display it in a window using VTK's vtkRenderWindowInteractor.
